#Let's Skewer

My friend came to me the other day and asked me to make a website where people could be totally honest about him. "I want everything terrible," he said to me. 

He thought that it was an amazing idea. Oddly, I agreed with him.

##The Implementation

I've abstracted it away from just skewering him--though the site I will have up to test it will be only for him, as of now, I am going to abstract it away from that so that anyone can be skewered.

* Anonymity
  * He thought it was important to have anonymity for the poster. I agreed with him on this. 
  * Though, it's important to know what you've posted yourself--so there cannot be total anonymity--as long as the person being skewered cannot see who posted what, it's okay. For now, this is how it is being implemented. 
  * Though, at some point, I would like it to be more anonymous, it's important for the site's admins to have access to that information for the purposes of moderation.

* UI
  * There is none yet.
  * This is a todo.
